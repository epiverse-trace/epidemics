#' @title Run an age-structured SEIR-V epidemic model
#'
#' @description A compartmental model with an optional non-pharmaceutical
#' intervention and an optional vaccination regime. Allows heterogeneity in 
#' social contact patterns, and variable sizes of demographic groups.
#' Also allows for group-specific initial proportions in each model 
#' compartment, as well as group-specific vaccination start dates and 
#' vaccination rates, and also group-specific effects of implementing a
#' non-pharmaceutical intervention.
#' The model only allows for single, population-wide rates of
#' transition between the 'susceptible' and 'exposed' compartments, between the
#' 'exposed' and 'infectious' compartments, and in the recovery rate.
#'
#' @param population An object of the `population` class, which holds a
#' population contact matrix, a demography vector, and the initial conditions
#' of each demographic group. See [population()].
#' @param beta The transmission rate \eqn{\beta}.
#' @param alpha The rate of transition from exposed to infectious \eqn{\alpha}.
#' @param gamma The recovery rate \eqn{\gamma}.
#' @param time_end The maximum time, defaults to 200.0.
#' @param intervention A non-pharamaceutical intervention applied during the
#' course of the epidemic, with a start and end time, and age-specific effect
#' on contacts. See [intervention()].
#' @param vaccination A vaccination regime followed during the
#' course of the epidemic, with a start and end time, and age-specific effect
#' on the transition of individuals from susceptible to vaccinated.
#' See [vaccination()].
#' @param increment The increment time, defaults to 0.1.
#' @return A two element list, where the first element is a list of matrices
#' whose elements correspond to the numbers of individuals in each compartment
#' as specified in the initial conditions matrix (see [population()]).
#' The second list element is a vector of timesteps.
