#' @title Run an age-structured SEIR epidemic model
#'
#' @param population An object of the `population` class, which holds a
#' population contact matrix, a demography vector, and the initial conditions
#' of each demographic group. See [population()].
#' @param beta The transmission rate \eqn{\beta}.
#' @param alpha The rate of transition from exposed to infectious \eqn{\alpha}.
#' @param gamma The recovery rate \eqn{\gamma}.
#' @param time_end The maximum time, defaults to 200.0.
#' @param intervention A non-pharamaceutical intervention applied during the
#' course of the epidemic, with a start and end time, and age-specific effect
#' on contacts. See [intervention()].
#' @param nu The vaccination rate \eqn{\nu}. Must be a
#' vector of the same length as the number of demographic groups.
#' @param t_vax_begin The time at which vaccination begins. Must be a vector,
#' each element giving the time of vaccination starting for each age group.
#' @param t_vax_end The time at which vaccination end. Must be a vector,
#' with each element giving the time of vaccination ending for each age group.
#' @param increment The increment time, defaults to 0.1.
#' @return A two element list, where the first element is a list of matrices
#' whose elements correspond to the numbers of individuals in each compartment
#' as specified in the initial conditions matrix (see [population()]).
#' The second list element is a vector of timesteps.
#' @keywords internal
