#' Get the epidemic size
#'
#' Get the size of the epidemic at any stage between the start and the end.
#' This is calculated as the number of individuals _recovered_ from infection
#' at that stage of the epidemic.
#'
#' This function can be used to calculate the
#' _final size_ of the epidemic, by setting `stage = 1.0` (100% of model time;
#' the default).
#'
#' The function allows for the calculation of epidemic sizes by demographic
#' group as well as the total epidemic size.
#'
#' @param data A `<data.frame>` of model output, typically
#' the output of [model_default_cpp()] or similar functions.
#' @param stage The stage of the epidemic at which to return the epidemic size;
#' here, 0.0 represents the initial conditions of the epidemic (0% of model time
#' ), while 1.0 represents the end of the epidemic model (100% of model time).
#' The values returned at `stage = 1.0` represent the _final size_ of the
#' epidemic.
#' @param by_group A logical representing whether the epidemic size should be
#' returned by demographic group, or whether a single population-wide value is
#' returned. Defaults to `TRUE`.
#' @param include_deaths A logical value that indicates whether to count dead
#' individuals in the epidemic size calculation.
#' Defaults to `TRUE`, which makes the function look for a `"dead"` compartment
#' in the data. If there is no such column, the function returns
#' only the final number of recovered or removed individuals in each demographic
#' group.
#' @return A single number when `by_group = FALSE`, or a vector of numbers of
#' the same length as the number of demographic groups when `by_group = TRUE`.
#' Returns the absolute sizes and not proportions.
