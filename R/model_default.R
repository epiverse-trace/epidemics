#' @title Model an SEIR-V epidemic with interventions
#'
#' @name model_default
#' @rdname model_default
#'
#' @description Simulate an epidemic using a deterministic, compartmental
#' epidemic model with the compartments
#' "susceptible", "exposed", "infectious", "recovered", and "vaccinated".
#' This model can accommodate heterogeneity in social contacts among demographic
#' groups, as well as differences in the sizes of demographic groups.
#'
#' The `population`, `transmissibility`, `infectiousness_rate`, and
#' `recovery_rate`
#' arguments are mandatory, while passing an `intervention` and `vaccination`
#' are optional and can be used to simulate scenarios with different epidemic
#' responses or different levels of the same type of response.
#' See **Details** for more information.
#'
#' @param population An object of the `population` class, which holds a
#' population contact matrix, a demography vector, and the initial conditions
#' of each demographic group. See [population()].
#' @param transmissibility A single number for the rate at which individuals
#' move from the susceptible to the exposed compartment upon contact with an
#' infectious individual. Often denoted as \eqn{\beta}, with
#' \eqn{\beta = R_0 / \text{infectious period}}.
#' @param infectiousness_rate A single number for the rate at which individuals
#' move from the exposed to the infectious compartment. Often denoted as
#' \eqn{\sigma}, with \eqn{\sigma = 1.0 / \text{pre-infectious period}}.
#' This value does not depend upon the number of infectious individuals in the
#' population.
#' @param recovery_rate A single number for the rate at which individuals move
#' from the infectious to the recovered compartment. Often denoted as
#' \eqn{\gamma}, with \eqn{\gamma = 1.0 / \text{infectious period}}.
#' @param intervention A named list of `<intervention>`s representing optional
#' non-pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical interventions applied during the
#' epidemic. Only a single intervention on social contacts of the class
#' `<contacts_intervention>` is allowed as the named element "contacts".
#' Multiple `<rate_interventions>` on the model parameters are allowed; see
#' **Details** for the model parameters for which interventions are supported.
#' @param vaccination A `<vaccination>` object representing an optional
#' vaccination regime with a single dose, followed during the course of the
#' epidemic, with a start and end time, and age-specific vaccination rates.
#' @param time_dependence A named list of functions that modify model parameters
#' as a function of model time. List element names must correspond to model
#' parameter names. List elements must be functions of the form
#' `function(time, x, ...)`, where `time` is the simulation `time` and `x`
#' represents a model parameter. The order of function arguments is important.
#' @param time_end The maximum number of timesteps over which to run the model.
#' Taken as days, with a default value of 200 days.
#' @param increment The size of the time increment. Taken as days, with a
#' default value of 1 day.
#' @details
#'
#' ## R and Rcpp implementations
#'
#' `model_default_cpp()` is a wrapper function for the internal C++ function
#' [.model_default_cpp()] that uses Boost _odeint_ solvers, while
#' `model_default_r()` is a wrapper around [deSolve::lsoda()] which an R-only
#' implementation of the ODE system in `.ode_model_default()`.
#' Both models return equivalent results, but the C++ implementation is faster.
#'
#' ## Model parameters
#'
#' This model only allows for single, population-wide rates of
#' transitions between compartments. The default values are:
#'
#' - Transmissibility (\eqn{\beta}, `transmissibility`): 0.186, assuming an
#' \eqn{R_0} = 1.3 and an infectious period of 7 days.
#'
#' - Infectiousness rate (\eqn{\sigma}, `infectiousness_rate`): 0.5, assuming
#' a pre-infectious period of 2 days.
#'
#' - Recovery rate (\eqn{\gamma}, `recovery_rate`): 0.143, assuming an
#' infectious period of 7 days.
#'
#' @return A `data.frame` with the columns "time", "compartment", "age_group",
#' "value". The compartments correspond to the compartments of the model
#' chosen with `model`.
#' The current default model has the compartments "susceptible", "exposed",
#' "infectious", "recovered", and "vaccinated".
