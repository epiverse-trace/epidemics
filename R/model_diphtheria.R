#' @title Model a diphtheria outbreak using a compartmental ODE model

#' @rdname model_diphtheria
#'
#' @description Simulate a diphtheria outbreak using a deterministic,
#' compartmental ordinary differential equation model with the compartments
#' "susceptible", "exposed", "infectious", "hospitalised", and"recovered".
#' The model is based on Finger et al. (2019) and is intended to be used in the
#' context of internally displaced people (IDP) or refugee camps.
#' This model allows for a proportion of each demographic group to be vaccinated
#' at the start of the outbreak, and thus to not contribute to the outbreak.
#' The model also allows for changes to the number of susceptibles in each age
#' group to model influxes or evacuations from camps.
#'
#' @inheritParams model_default
#' @param reporting_rate A numeric for the proportion of infectious cases
#' that is reported; this is a precursor to hospitalisation as only reported
#' cases are hospitalised.
#' @param prop_hosp A numeric for the proportion of reported cases that is
#' hospitalised.
#' @param hosp_entry_rate A numeric for the rate at which reported cases
#' of infectious individuals are hospitalised.
#' This is calculated as 1 / time to hospitalisation, denoted \eqn{\tau_1}.
#' @param hosp_exit_rate A numeric for the rate at which individuals are
#' discharged from hospital to enter the 'recovered' compartment.
#' This is calculated as 1 / time to discharge, denoted \eqn{\tau_2}.
#' @param prop_vaccinated A numeric vector of the same length as the number of
#' demographic groups indicated the proportion of each group that is vaccinated.
#' These individuals are not included in the model dynamics.
#' @param intervention A named list of `<rate_intervention>` objects
#' representing optional pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions
#' applied to the model parameters listed above.
#' @param population_change A two-element list, with elements named `"time"` and
#' `"values"`, giving the times of population changes, and the corresponding
#' changes in the population of each demographic group at those times.
#' `"time"` must be a numeric vector, while `"values"` must be a list of the
#' length of `"time"`, with each element a numeric vector of the same length as
#' the number of demographic groups in `population`.

#' # Details: Model an infection outbreak in a humanitarian camp setting
#'
#' This model has been developed for diphtheria outbreaks in settings where
#' interventions on social contacts are difficult to implement. It it suitable
#' for application to the outbreak of similar, directly transmitted infectious
#' diseases as well.
#'
#' ## Model parameters
#'
#' This model only allows for single, population-wide rates transitions between
#' compartments per model run.
#'
#' However, model parameters may be passed as numeric vectors. These vectors
#' must follow Tidyverse recycling rules: all vectors must have the same length,
#' or, vectors of length 1 will be recycled to the length of any other vector.
#'
#' The default values are taken from Finger et al. (2019) where possible:
#'
#' - Transmission rate (\eqn{\beta}, `transmission_rate`): 0.8888889, assuming
#' an \eqn{R_0} of 4.0 and a total infectious period of 4.5 days.
#'
#' - Infectiousness rate (\eqn{\sigma}, `infectiousness_rate`): 0.333, assuming
#' a pre-infectious period of 3 days.
#'
#' - Reporting rate (\eqn{r}, `reporting_rate`): 0.03, assuming that 3% of
#' infectious cases are detected or reported.
#'
#' - Proportion hospitalised (\eqn{\eta}, `prop_hosp`): 0.01, assuming that 1%
#' of reported cases need hospital treatment.
#'
#' - Hospital entry rate (\eqn{\tau_1}, `hosp_entry_rate`): 0.2, assuming that
#' it takes 5 days for infectious individuals to seek hospital treatment.
#'
#' - Hospital exit rate (\eqn{\tau_2}, `hosp_exit_rate`): 0.2, assuming that
#' individuals are discharged from hospital after 5 days.
#'
#' - Recovery rate (\eqn{\gamma}, `recovery_rate`): 0.333, assuming an
#' infectious period following symptoms, of 3 days.
#'
#' ## Modelling population changes
#'
#' This model allows changes to the number of susceptibles in each demographic
#' group, to represent influxes or evacuations from the camp as would be
#' expected in humanitarian relief situations.
#' Users can specify the times and changes (to each demographic group) of
#' changes using the `population_changes` argument, to examine the effect on
#' outbreak dynamics.
