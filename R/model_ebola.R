#' @title Model an Ebola virus disease epidemic
#' @name epidemic_ebola
#' @rdname epidemic_ebola
#'
#' @description Simulate an epidemic using a discrete-time, stochastic SEIR
#' compartmental model with compartments based on Li et al. (2019), and with
#' Erlang passage times based on a model developed by Getz and Dougherty (2017),
#' developed to model the West African Ebola virus disease outbreak of 2014.
#' See **Details** for more information.
#'
#' `model_ebola_cpp()` is an Rcpp implementation of this model that currently
#' lags behind the R implementation, and is likely to be removed.
#'
#' @param population An object of the `<population>` class, see [population()].
#'
#' This model only accepts a `<population>` without demographic structure, that
#' is, the `demography_vector` must be a single number representing the total
#' size of the affected population.
#'
#' The model also does not account for demographic differences in social
#' contacts, which means that the `contact_matrix` is ignored. For consistency,
#' the matrix must be square and have as many rows as demography groups, which
#' is one.
#'
#' @param infection An `<infection>` object created using [infection()]. Must
#' have:
#'
#' - `r0`, a single number for the basic reproductive number \eqn{R_0} of the
#' infection,
#'
#' - `infectious_period`, a single number for the infectious period, taken to be
#' in days,
#'
#' - `preinfectious_period`, a single number for the pre-infectious period
#' before the onset of symptoms, taken to be in days,
#'
#' - `prop_community`, a single number in the range 0.0 -- 1.0 for the
#' proportion of infectious (assumed symptomatic) individuals who are not
#' hospitalised, and are instead infectious in the community,
#'
#' - `etu_risk`, a single number in the range 0.0 -- 1.0 for the relative
#' risk of EVD transmission in hospital settings (in Ebola Treatment Units; ETU)
#' between hospitalised individuals and susceptible ones.
#' This is understood to be a proportion of the baseline transmission rate
#' \eqn{\beta}, which is calculated from the `<infection>`.
#' 0.0 would indicate that hospitalisation completely eliminates transmission,
#' while 1.0 would indicate that transmission between hospitalised individuals
#' and susceptibles is the same as the baseline, which is transmission in the
#' community.
#'
#' - `funeral_risk`, a single number in the range 0.0 -- 1.0 for the relative
#' risk of funeral practices that may lead to transmission of EVD in a funeral
#' setting.
#' This is understood to be a proportion of the baseline transmission rate
#' \eqn{\beta}, which is calculated from the `<infection>`. It can alternatively
#' be interpreted as the proportion of funerals at which the risk of
#' transmission is the same as of infectious individuals in the community.
#'
#' `r0`, `infectious_period`, and `preinfectious_period` are used to calculate
#' the baseline transmission rate \eqn{\beta},
#' as well as the rates \eqn{\gamma^E} and \eqn{\gamma^I} at which individuals
#' move from the 'exposed' to the 'infectious' compartment, and from the
#' 'infectious' to the 'recovered' compartment, respectively.
#' See **Details** for more information.
#'
#' @param intervention An optional `<rate_intervention>` object representing
#' pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions applied to the infection's
#' parameters, such as the transmission rate, over the epidemic.
#' See [intervention()] for details on constructing rate interventions.
#' Defaults to `NULL`, representing no interventions on model parameters.
#'
#' @param time_dependence A named list where each name
#' is a model parameter (see `infection`), and each element is a function with
#' the first two arguments being the current simulation `time`, and `x`, a value
#' that is dependent on `time` (`x` represents a model parameter).
#' See **Details** for more information, as well as the vignette on time-
#' dependence \code{vignette("time_dependence", package = "epidemics")}.
#' @param time_end The maximum number of timesteps over which to run the model,
#' in days. Defaults to 100 days.
#' @return
#' A `<data.table>` in
#' long format with the columns "time", "compartment", "age_group", and "value",
#' that gives the number of individuals in each model compartment over time (
#' from 1 to `time_end`).
#' @details
#'
#' # Details: Discrete-time ebola virus disease model
#'
#' This model has compartments adopted from the consensus model for Ebola virus
#' disease presented in Li et al. (2019), and with transitions between
#' epidemiological compartments modelled using Erlang sub-compartments adapted
#' from Getz and Dougherty (2018); see **References**.
#'
#' The R code for this model is adapted from code by Hạ Minh Lâm and initially
#' made available on _Epirecipes_ (https://github.com/epirecipes/epicookbook)
#' under the MIT licence.
#'
#' The model implementation differs from Getz and Dougherty's (2018) in
#' allowing users to set the basic reproductive number \eqn{R_0}, and the mean
#' infectious (\eqn{\rho^I} in Getz and Dougherty) and pre-infectious periods in
#' days (\eqn{\rho^E} in Getz and Dougherty).
#' Getz and Dougherty instead calculate these from other model parameters.
#'
#' The shape of the Erlang distributions of passage times through the exposed
#' and infectious compartments (\eqn{k^E} and \eqn{k^I}) are fixed to 2 (this
#' was allowed to vary in Getz and Dougherty).
#'
#' The transition rates between the exposed and infectious, and infectious and
#' funeral compartments, \eqn{\gamma^E} and \eqn{\gamma^I} in Getz and
#' Dougherty's notation, are calculated following their equation (6).
#' \deqn{\gamma^E = \dfrac{k^E}{\rho^E} = \dfrac{2}{\rho^E} ~\text{and}~
#' \gamma^I = \dfrac{k^I}{\rho^I} = \dfrac{2}{\rho^I}}
#'
#' In this discrete time model, \eqn{\gamma^E} and \eqn{\gamma^I} are used to
#' determine the number of Erlang sub-compartments in each epidemiological
#' compartment, and the probability of newly exposed or infectious individuals
#' beginning in one of the compartments (thus allowing for variation in passage
#' times).
#'
#' ## Hospitalisation, funerals, and removal
#'
#' A proportion, `1.0 - prop_community`, of infectious individuals are
#' transferred to the hospitalised compartment in each timestep,
#' This compartment represents Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs), and individuals
#' in the hospitalised compartment are considered to be infectious but no longer
#' in the community.
#' This compartment has the same number of sub-compartments as the infectious
#' compartment (i.e., infectious in the community), which means that
#' an infectious individual with \eqn{N} timesteps before exiting the
#' infectious compartment will exit the hospitalised compartment in the same
#' time.
#'
#' Hospitalised individuals can contribute to transmission of Ebola to
#' susceptibles depending on the value of `etu_risk` passed as part of the
#' `infection` argument, which scales the
#' baseline transmission rate \eqn{\beta} for hospitalised individuals.
#'
#' We assume that deaths in hospital lead to Ebola-safe funerals, and
#' individuals exiting the hospitalised compartment move to the 'removed'
#' compartment, which holds both recoveries and deaths.
#'
#' We assume that deaths outside of hospital lead to funerals that are
#' potentially unsafe burials, and the `funeral_risk` passed as part of the
#' `infection` argument scales the baseline transmission rate \eqn{\beta} for
#' funeral transmission of Ebola to susceptibles.
#'
#' Individuals are assumed to spend only a single timestep in the funeral
#' transmission compartment, before they move into the 'removed' compartment.
#'
#' Individuals in the 'removed' compartment do no affect model dynamics.
#'
#' ## Implementing vaccination
#'
#' Vaccination cannot currently be implemented in this model as it does not have
#' a "vaccinated" epidemiological compartment. This prevents the use of a
#' `<vaccination>` object.
#'
#' Instead, users can use the `time_dependence` argument to pass a function that
#' modifies model parameters --- specifically, the transmission rate --- in a
#' way that is consistent with the effect of vaccination.
#' An example is shown in the vignette about this model; run this code to open
#' the vignette: \code{vignette("ebola_model", package = "epidemics")}
