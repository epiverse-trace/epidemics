#' @title Model an Ebola virus disease epidemic
#' @name model_ebola
#' @rdname model_ebola
#'
#' @description Simulate an epidemic using a discrete-time, stochastic SEIR
#' compartmental model with compartments based on Li et al. (2019), and with
#' Erlang passage times based on a model developed by Getz and Dougherty (2017),
#' developed to model the West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak of
#' 2013 -- 2016.
#' See **Details** for more information.
#'
#' `model_ebola_cpp()` is an Rcpp implementation of this model that currently
#' lags behind the R implementation, and is likely to be removed.
#'
#' @param population An object of the `<population>` class, see [population()].
#'
#' This model only accepts a `<population>` without demographic structure, that
#' is, the `demography_vector` must be a single number representing the total
#' size of the affected population.
#'
#' The model also does not account for demographic differences in social
#' contacts, which means that the `contact_matrix` is ignored. For consistency,
#' the matrix must be square and have as many rows as demography groups, which
#' is one.
#' @param erlang_subcompartments The number of Erlang subcompartments assumed
#' for the exposed, infectious, and hospitalised compartments. Defaults to 2.
#' @inheritParams model_default
#' @param removal_rate The rate at which infectious individuals transition from
#' the infectious or hospitalised compartments to the funeral or removed
#' compartments. This model does not distinguish between recoveries and
#' deaths. Denoted in Getz and Dougherty as \eqn{\gamma^I} (see **Details**).
#' @param prop_community The proportion of infectious individuals who remain in
#' the community and are not hospitalised for treatment. Defaults to 0.5
#' @param etu_risk The relative risk of onward transmission of EVD from
#' hospitalised individuals. Must be a single value between 0.0 and 1.0, where
#' 0.0 indicates that hospitalisation completely prevents onward transmission,
#' and 1.0 indicates that hospitalisation does not prevent onward transmission
#' at all. `etu_risk` is used to scale the value of transmissibility for the
#' transmissibility \eqn{\beta}. Defaults to 0.2.
#' @param funeral_risk The relative risk of onward transmission of EVD from
#' funerals of individuals who died with EVD.
#' Must be a single value between 0.0 and 1.0, where
#' 0.0 indicates that there is no onward transmission, and 1.0 indicates that
#' funeral transmission is equivalent to transmission in the community.
#' `funeral_risk` is used to scale the value of transmissibility for the
#' transmissibility \eqn{\beta}. Defaults to 0.5.
#' @param intervention An optional `<rate_intervention>` object representing
#' pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions applied to the infection's
#' parameters, such as the transmission rate, over the epidemic.
#' See [intervention()] for details on constructing rate interventions.
#' Defaults to `NULL`, representing no interventions on model parameters.
#'
#' @param time_dependence A named list where each name
#' is a model parameter (see `infection`), and each element is a function with
#' the first two arguments being the current simulation `time`, and `x`, a value
#' that is dependent on `time` (`x` represents a model parameter).
#' See **Details** for more information, as well as the vignette on time-
#' dependence \code{vignette("time_dependence", package = "epidemics")}.
#' @param time_end The maximum number of timesteps over which to run the model,
#' in days. Defaults to 100 days.
#' @return
#' A `<data.table>` in
#' long format with the columns "time", "compartment", "age_group", and "value",
#' that gives the number of individuals in each model compartment over time (
#' from 1 to `time_end`).
#' @details
#'
#' # Details: Discrete-time ebola virus disease model
#'
#' This model has compartments adopted from the consensus model for Ebola virus
#' disease presented in Li et al. (2019), and with transitions between
#' epidemiological compartments modelled using Erlang sub-compartments adapted
#' from Getz and Dougherty (2018); see **References**.
#'
#' The R code for this model is adapted from code by Ha Minh Lam and
#' initially made available on _Epirecipes_
#' (https://github.com/epirecipes/epicookbook) under the MIT license.
#'
#' The shape of the Erlang distributions of passage times through the exposed
#' and infectious compartments (\eqn{k^E} and \eqn{k^I}) are recommended to be
#' set to 2 as a sensible choice, which is the default value for the
#' `erlang_sbubcompartments` argument, but can be allowed to vary
#' (but not independently).
#'
#' The transition rates between the exposed and infectious, and infectious and
#' funeral compartments (and also hospitalised to removed),
#' \eqn{\gamma^E} and \eqn{\gamma^I} in Getz and Dougherty's notation, are
#' passed by the user as the `infectiousness_rate` and `removal_rate`
#' respectively.
#'
#' Getz and Dougherty's equation (6) gives the relationship between these
#' parameters and the mean pre-infectious \eqn{\rho^E} and infectious
#' \eqn{\rho^I} periods.
#' \deqn{\gamma^E = \dfrac{k^E}{\rho^E} = \dfrac{2}{\rho^E} ~\text{and}~
#' \gamma^I = \dfrac{k^I}{\rho^I} = \dfrac{2}{\rho^I}}
#'
#' In this discrete time model, \eqn{\gamma^E} and \eqn{\gamma^I} are used to
#' determine the passage times of newly exposed or infectious individuals
#' through their respective compartments (thus allowing for variation in passage
#' times).
#'
#' ## Hospitalisation, funerals, and removal
#'
#' A proportion, `1.0 - prop_community`, of infectious individuals are
#' transferred to the hospitalised compartment in each timestep,
#' This compartment represents Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs), and individuals
#' in the hospitalised compartment are considered to be infectious but no longer
#' in the community.
#'
#' The passage time of individuals in the hospitalised compartment is similar to
#' that of individuals in the infectious compartment (i.e., infectious in the
#' community), which means that an infectious individual with \eqn{N} timesteps
#' before exiting the infectious compartment will exit the hospitalised
#' compartment in the same time.
#'
#' Hospitalised individuals can contribute to transmission of Ebola to
#' susceptibles depending on the value of `etu_risk` passed as part of the
#' `infection` argument, which scales the
#' baseline transmission rate \eqn{\beta} for hospitalised individuals.
#'
#' We assume that deaths in hospital lead to Ebola-safe funerals, and
#' individuals exiting the hospitalised compartment move to the 'removed'
#' compartment, which holds both recoveries and deaths.
#'
#' We assume that deaths outside of hospital lead to funerals that are
#' potentially unsafe burials, and the `funeral_risk` argument scales the
#' baseline transmission rate \eqn{\beta} for funeral transmission of Ebola to
#' susceptibles.
#'
#' Individuals are assumed to spend only a single timestep in the funeral
#' transmission compartment, before they move into the 'removed' compartment.
#'
#' Individuals in the 'removed' compartment do no affect model dynamics.
#'
#' ## Model parameters
#'
#' The default values are:
#'
#' - Transmissibility (\eqn{\beta}, `transmissibility`): 0.125, resulting from
#' an \eqn{R_0} = 1.5 and an infectious period of 12 days.
#'
#' - Infectiousness rate (\eqn{\gamma^E}, `infectiousness_rate`): 0.4, assuming
#' a pre-infectious period of 5 days and two Erlang subcompartments.
#'
#' - Removal rate (\eqn{\gamma^I}, `recovery_rate`): 0.1667, assuming an
#' infectious period of 12 days and two Erlang subcompartments.
#'
#' ## Implementing vaccination
#'
#' Vaccination cannot currently be implemented in this model as it does not have
#' a "vaccinated" epidemiological compartment. This prevents the use of a
#' `<vaccination>` object.
#'
#' Instead, users can use the `time_dependence` argument to pass a function that
#' modifies model parameters --- specifically, the transmission rate --- in a
#' way that is consistent with the effect of vaccination.
#' An example is shown in the vignette about this model; run this code to open
#' the vignette: \code{vignette("ebola_model", package = "epidemics")}
