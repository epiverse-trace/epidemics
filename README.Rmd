# _{{ packagename }}_: A library of compartmental epidemic scenario models
<!-- <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="130"/> -->

_{{ packagename }}_ is an R package that provides an easy interface to a library of compartmental models that can help to model epidemic scenarios for directly transmitted infections such as influenza, Covid-19, or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

_{{ packagename }}_ currently provides a single model with susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered, and vaccinated compartments (SEIR-V), allowing for heterogeneity in social contacts, the implementation of a group-specific non-pharmaceutical intervention that reduces social contacts, and a vaccination regime with group-specific start and end dates.

_{{ packagename }}_ implements methods outlined in @bjornstad2020 and @bjornstad2020a.

The models in _{{ packagename }}_ can help provide rough estimates of the course of epidemics, and the effectiveness of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions

_{{ packagename }}_ relies on [Eigen](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen) via [{RcppEigen}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppEigen/index.html), and on [Boost Odeint](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_82_0/libs/numeric/odeint/doc/html/index.html) via [{BH}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BH/index.html), and is developed at the [Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as part of the [Epiverse-TRACE initiative](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).

## Installation

The current development version of _finalsize_ can be installed from _{{ packagename }}_ from [GitHub](https://github.com/) using the `pak` package:

```r
if(!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("{{ gh_repo }}")
```

## Quick start

Here we show an example of using _{{ packagename }}_ to model an epidemic in the U.K. population with an $R_0$ similar to that of pandemic influenza, with heterogeneity in social contacts among different age groups, and with the implementation of school closures to dampen the spread of the infection.

```{r}
# load epidemics
library(epidemics)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
```

Prepare the social contact pattern for a population (here, the U.K population), divided into three age groups: 0 -- 19, 20 -- 39, and 40+.

```{r}
# load contact and population data from socialmixr::polymod
polymod <- socialmixr::polymod
contact_data <- socialmixr::contact_matrix(
  polymod,
  countries = "United Kingdom",
  age.limits = c(0, 20, 40),
  symmetric = TRUE
)

# prepare contact matrix
contact_matrix <- t(contact_data$matrix)

# prepare the demography vector
demography_vector <- contact_data$demography$population
names(demography_vector) <- rownames(contact_matrix)
```

Prepare the initial conditions for the population by age group --- here, one in every million individuals is infected at the start of the epidemic (for a total of about 60 infections).

```{r}
# initial conditions: one in every 1 million is infected
initial_i <- 1e-6
initial_conditions <- c(
  S = 1 - initial_i, E = 0, I = initial_i, R = 0, V = 0
)

# build for all age groups
initial_conditions <- rbind(
  initial_conditions,
  initial_conditions,
  initial_conditions
)
rownames(initial_conditions) <- rownames(contact_matrix)
```

Prepare an object of the class `<population>`, using the function `population()`.

```{r}
# prepare the population to model as affected by the epidemic
uk_population <- population(
  name = "UK",
  contact_matrix = contact_matrix,
  demography_vector = demography_vector,
  initial_conditions = initial_conditions
)
```

Define an intervention to close schools for two months. This intervention mostly only affects individuals in the age range 0 -- 19, and reduces their contacts by 50%, reducing the contacts of other age groups by 1%. This is an object of the class `<intervention>`, created using the function `intervention()`.

```{r}
# an intervention to close schools
close_schools <- intervention(
  time_begin = 200,
  time_end = 260,
  contact_reduction = c(0.5, 0.01, 0.01)
)
```

Run the default epidemic model, using the function `epidemic()`. We assume an $R_0$ of 1.5 which is similar to pandemic influenza, an infectious period of 7 days, and a pre-infectious period of 3 days.

```{r message=FALSE}
# run an epidemic model using `epidemic()`
output <- epidemic(
  model = "default",
  population = uk_population,
  r0 = 1.5,
  preinfectious_period = 3,
  infectious_period = 7,
  intervention = close_schools,
  time_end = 600, increment = 1.0
)
```

Visualise the development of individuals in the "infectious" compartment over model time. Note that these curves represent the number of individuals that are infectious, and not the number of newly infectious individuals.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# convert to data.table for manipulation
setDT(output)

# collect infectious compartments by age
data_infectious <- output[, .SD,
  .SDcols = names(output) %like% "infectious|time"
]

data_infectious <- melt(data_infectious, id.vars = "time")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data_infectious) +
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = c(close_schools$time_begin, close_schools$time_end),
    colour = "red",
    linetype = "dashed",
    linewidth = 0.2
  ) +
  annotate(
    geom = "text",
    label = "Schools closed",
    colour = "red",
    x = 230, y = 400e3,
    angle = 90,
    vjust = "outward"
  ) +
  geom_line(
    aes(time, value, colour = variable)
  ) +
  scale_colour_brewer(
    palette = "Dark2",
    labels = rownames(contact_matrix),
    name = NULL
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::comma,
    name = "Individuals infected"
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Model time (days)"
  ) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "top"
  )
```
