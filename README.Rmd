# _{{ packagename }}_: A library of compartmental epidemic scenario models
<!-- <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="130"/> -->

_{{ packagename }}_ is an R package that provides an easy interface to a library of compartmental models that can help to model epidemic scenarios for directly transmitted infections such as influenza, Covid-19, or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

_{{ packagename }}_ currently provides a single model with susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered, and vaccinated compartments (SEIR-V), allowing for heterogeneity in social contacts, the implementation of a group-specific non-pharmaceutical intervention that reduces social contacts, and a vaccination regime with group-specific start and end dates.

_{{ packagename }}_ implements methods outlined in @bjornstad2020 and @bjornstad2020a.

The models in _{{ packagename }}_ can help provide rough estimates of the course of epidemics, and the effectiveness of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions

_{{ packagename }}_ relies on [Eigen](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen) via [{RcppEigen}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppEigen/index.html), and on [Boost Odeint](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_82_0/libs/numeric/odeint/doc/html/index.html) via [{BH}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BH/index.html), and is developed at the [Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as part of the [Epiverse-TRACE initiative](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).
