\title{Get the epidemic size}
\usage{
epidemic_size(
  data,
  stage = 1,
  time = NULL,
  by_group = TRUE,
  include_deaths = FALSE,
  simplify = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A table of model output, typically
the output of \code{\link[=model_de  ault]{model_de  ault()}} or similar functions.}

\item{stage}{A numeric vector for the stage of the epidemic at which to
return the epidemic size; here 0.0 represents the start time of the epidemic
i.e., the initial conditions of the epidemic simulation, while 1.0 represents
the end of the epidemic simulation model (100\% of model time).
Defaults to 1.0, at which stage returned values represent the \emph{final size} of
the epidemic.
This value is overridden by any values passed to the \code{time} argument.}

\item{time}{Alternative to \code{stage}, an integer-like vector for the timepoint
of the epidemic at which to return the epidemic size.
Overrides any values passed to \code{stage}.}

\item{by_group}{A logical representing whether the epidemic size should be
returned by demographic group, or whether a single population-wide value is
returned. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{include_deaths}{A logical value that indicates whether to count dead
individuals in the epidemic size calculation.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Setting \code{include_deaths = TRUE} makes the function look
for a \code{"dead"} compartment in the data. If there is no such column, the
function returns only the final number of recovered or removed individuals in
each demographic group.}

\item{simplify}{A logical determining whether the epidemic size data should
be simplified to a vector with one element for each demographic group.
If the length of \code{stage} or \code{time} is $>$ 1, this argument is overridden and
the data are returned as a \verb{<data.table>}.}
}
\value{
If \code{simplify == TRUE} and a single timepoint is requested, returns a vector
of epidemic sizes of the same length as the number of demographic groups.
If \code{by_group == FALSE}, sums the epidemic size to return an overall value for
the full population.

If multiple timepoints are requested, or if multiple replicates are present
under a specially named column "replicate" (only from the Ebola model), no
simplification to a vector is possible; returns a \verb{<data.table>} of
timepoints and epidemic sizes at each timepoint.

All options return the absolute sizes and not proportions.
}
\description{
Get the size of the epidemic at any stage between the start and the end.
This is calculated as the number of individuals \emph{recovered} from infection
at that stage of the epidemic.
}
\details{
This function can be used to calculate the
\emph{final size} of the epidemic, by setting \code{stage = 1.0} (100\% of model time;
the default).

The function allows for the calculation of epidemic sizes by demographic
group as well as the total epidemic size.

\examples{
# create a population
uk_population <- population(
  name = "UK population",
  contact_matrix = matrix(1),
  demography_vector = 67e6,
  initial_conditions = matrix(
    c(0.9999, 0.0001, 0, 0, 0),
    nrow = 1, ncol = 5L
  )
)

# run epidemic simulation with no vaccination or intervention
data <- model_default(
  population = uk_population
)

# get the final epidemic size if no other arguments are specified
epidemic_size(data)

# get the epidemic size at the halfway point
epidemic_size(data, stage = 0.5)

# alternatively, get the epidemic size at `time = 50`
epidemic_size(data, time = 50)
}
