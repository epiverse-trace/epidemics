\title{Get new infections over model time}
\usage{
new_infections(data, compartments_from_susceptible = NULL, by_group = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \verb{<data.frame>} of model output, typically
the output of \code{\link[=model_default_cpp]{model_default_cpp()}} or similar functions.}

\item{compartments_from_susceptible}{An optional argument, for a character
vector of the names of model compartments into which individuals transition
from the "susceptible" compartment, and which are not related to infection.
A common example is a compartment for "vaccinated" individuals who are no
longer susceptible, but who should also not be counted as infected.}

\item{by_group}{A logical representing whether the epidemic size should be
returned by demographic group, or whether a single population-wide value is
returned.}
}
\value{
A \verb{<data.frame>} with the same columns as \code{data}, but with the
additional variable under \code{compartment}, "new_infections", resulting in
additional rows.
}
