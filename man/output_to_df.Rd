\usage{
.output_to_df(output, population, compartments)

.output_to_df_ebola(output, population, compartments)
}
\arguments{
\item{output}{The model output, which must be a two element list (for
epidemic) models, with the names "x" and "time", where "x" represents the
condition of each compartment at each timestep in "time".}

\item{population}{A \verb{<population>} object corresponding to the population
used in the epidemic model.
The \verb{<population>} object is used to generate the names of the demographic
groups, if these are named.}

\item{compartments}{A vector for the model compartment names.}
}
\value{
A \verb{<data.table>} with the columns "compartment", "demography_group",
"value", and "time"; these specify the epidemiological compartment, the
name of the demography group, the number of individuals of that group in the
compartment, and the model timestep, respectively.
Names for the demographic groups are generated if no names are provided in
the \code{population} object; these are of the form "demo_group_X".
