This vignette is intended to be a guide to making small, targeted edits to features in _epidemics_, and is aimed at current and future contributors, and at advanced users who might want to use a slightly modified local version of an _epidemics_-provided model for specific analyses.

**New to developing _epidemics_?** Please read the [vignette on design decisions taken during the development process](design-principles.html), and see the concept and architecture diagrams in that vignette.

## Scope

This vignette is structured around use cases of making package modifications given the exisiting package architecture.

Consequently this vignette does not cover major changes that would require a substantial rewrite of the package, such as switching the C++ solver used for ODE models, or switching to using _cpp11_ rather than _Rcpp_.

This vignette also does not tackle questions around epidemic modelling choices - such as which compartmenal transitions should be allowed; we strongly recommend the involvement of a specialist in such cases.

## Modifying which parameters can be time dependent

Making the infection parameters of existing models time-dependent is straightforward using the `time_dependence` argument to model functions.
Currently, all models support time-dependence on most infection parameters.
This _does not include_ the vaccination rate (see more on that below).

See the [vignette on time-dependence](modelling_time_dependence.html) for how this functionality currently works.

To modify which parameters of new or existing models can be made (optionally) time-dependent using the existing functionality:

1. For **ODE models**, first modify the `std::unordered_map` named `model_params` in the corresponding model source file, `src/model_*.cpp`, to add or remove a key-value pair. Adding a parameter to this map automatically enables both time-dependence as well as rate interventions; removing a parameter from this map means disallowing both.

2. Next, modify the model functions and the argument cross-checking functions to ensure that the model allows time-dependence and rate interventions on the correct set of infection parameters.

    - The vector of allowed targets for time-dependence is an argument to the function `.cross_check_timedep()` called in `model_*()` from `R/model_*.R`, while the vector of allowed targets for rate interventions is a similar argument to the function `.cross_check_intervention()` called in `.check_prepare_args_*()` from `R/check_args_*.R`; in all cases `*` refers to the model name.

    - This initial cross-checking is required to prevent errors in the C++ code (typically, a key-not-found error) which may be difficult for users to understand and fix.

3. Finally, ODE model code can be simplified to remove time-dependence (and rate interventions, or one of them) entirely by deleting the call to `time_dependence::apply_time_dependence` in the ODE model `FunctionObject` in `inst/include/model_*.h`. This will not affect upstream code, and may be one way of gaining a small improvement in model performance, so long as time-dependence is not required.

4. For the **stochastic Ebola model**, infection parameters are held in a named list called `parameters`. The elements of this list that are targeted for time-dependence are modified within the model loop.

    - Adding parameters to the list allows them to be be targeted by inbuilt time-dependence functionality.
    
    - _However_, removing parameters from the list will lead to errors as they are needed for compartmental transitions. Instead, add input checks on the arguments `intervention` and `time_dependence` to prevent these elements from being modified.
    
    - Remove the appropriate code from within the loop to completely disallow time-dependence and rate interventions without affecting upstream code.

    - _Note that_ the Ebola model does support modifying the infectiousness rate or the removal rate, as these are used to calculate the number of sub-compartments (representing days) in each epidemiological compartment; these values must remain fixed throughout the model's run time.

## Modifying compartmental flows without changing compartments

Modifying compartmental flows is straightforward for the ODE models in _epidemics_. This is not easy for the stochastic Ebola model due to the use of discrete-time flows between sub-compartments rather than probabilistic flows between compartments.
We shall not discuss the Ebola model further here.

::: {.alert .alert-warning}
**Note that** existing compartmenal flows are typically controlled by infection parameters, which can be set to zero to disallow specific transitions. For example, to simulate a scenario in which hospitalisation is not available, the Vacamole model can be run with the argument `hospitalisation_rate = 0.0`.

Please check whether setting an infection parameter to zero better suits your use case.

This section focuses on adding novel inflows and outflows via some illustrative examples.

1. First, navigate to the end of each model `FunctionObject` defined in `inst/include/model_*.h` and edit the ODEs found there (see examples below). Users can hard-code the parameter values in these files for quick edits, but we recommend taking the next few steps to allow changing these values from R.

2. Next, modify the C++ function arguments in `src/model_*.cpp` so that any newly added rate parameters can be passed from R to C++. Typically, single parameters should be passed by reference as `const double`.

  - If you seek to use time-dependence and rate interventions with the newly added parameters should follow the steps in the section above.

3. Finally, modify the R code in `R/model_*.R` so that the R function accepts the new parameter as an appropriately checked argument.

4. When adding parameters such as birth and death rates, make sure that this is accounted for in any unit tests (see especially the current expectation in most models that there is a constant population size).

### Modelling births to $S$ and deaths from all compartments

Define birth rate and background mortality rate parameters (denoted $b$ and $d$ respectively), and modify the compartmental transitions as follows. This example shows only the equations for the susceptible compartment.

    ```c++
    // Add births to S, where b is the birth rate, and N is the population size
    dxdt.col(0) = B -sToE - sToV;  // B -β*S*contacts*I - ν

    // Add deaths to S, where d is the death rate, and N is the population size
    dxdt.col(0) = B -sToE - sToV - dS;  // B -β*S*contacts*I - ν - dS
    ```

  - For a model with age stratification, note that `B` and `d * S` ($d_i S_i$) have to be of the type `Eigen::ArrayXd`, and of the same length as the number of demographic groups, to represent the flows in to and out of each age group.
  
  - To simulate births as the only inflow in an age-stratified model, `B` must have the same length as `N`, with only the first element having a non-zero value. `B` is still required to be a vector for compatibility with other vector/array elements. Setting other values of `B` to be non-zero positive values can be used to model immigration or other long-term processes.

    ```c++
    // where `x` is the current state matrix
    // get current population size
    // recall rows are demography groups, columns are compartments
    const Eigen::ArrayXd population_size = x.rowwise().sum();

    // define a birth rate
    const double b = 1e-3;

    // calculate number of births
    double births_ = (b * population_size.sum());
    
    // create the vector `B`
    Eigen::ArrayXd births(4);  // hardcoded for four age groups
    // fill all values as 0.0
    births.fill(0.0);
    // set the first value to births_
    births(0) = births_;
    ```

  - To add an immigration component, continue from the example above. Note that 'immigration' here is used in the population dynamics sense of the term, and simply means individuals entering the population.

    ```c++
    // a uniform value for the rate of immigration in all age groups
    const double immigration_rate = SOME_VALUE;

    // calculate immigration as a proportion of each age group
    const Eigen::ArrayXd immigration = immigration_rate * population_size;

    // sum births and immigration
    const Eigen::ArrayXd all_inflows = births + immigration;
    ```

  - Deaths from each comparment can be similarly included. Background mortality, i.e., not related to the epidemic can be modelled as a vector of mortality rates `d` multiplied by the size of each demographic group $i$ in any compartment $X$, as either $-dX_i$ for uniform background mortality, or $-d_i X_i$ for age-specific mortality.

### Modelling sources of infectious individuals such as from zoonotic spillover_rate

Define a uniform spillover rate and add this to the $S \rightarrow I$ transition.

    ```c++
    // define a uniform spillover rate from contact with animals
    const double spillover_rate = SOME_VALUE;

    // include this additional S -> E transition
    // note x.col(0).array() is the vector of age-specific susceptibles
    const Eigen::ArrayXd zoonotic_infection = spillover_rate * x.col(0).array();

    dxdt.col(0) = -sToE - sToV - zoonotic_infection;  // -β*S*contacts*I - ν - zoonotic infection
    ```

### Modelling waning immunity

Similar to previous examples, define a uniform waning rate for the immunity of recovered individuals and modify the appropriate compartmental transitions.

    ```c++
    // define an age-specific waning rate
    const double waning_rate = SOME_VALUE;

    // include this new R -> S transition
    // note x.col(3).array() is the vector of age-specific recovereds
    const Eigen::ArrayXd re_susceptibles = waning_rate * x.col(3).array();

    // add individuals with renewed susceptibility
    dxdt.col(0) = -sToE - sToV + re_susceptibles;  // -β*S*contacts*I - ν - re_susceptibles
    ```
